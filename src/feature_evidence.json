Add boolean state guards at minimum: `kamusSaving`, `aturanSaving`, `mapSaving`, `konstantaSaving`. Every Master Data save/update/delete handler must: (1) exit early if its guard is already true, (2) set the guard to true immediately before awaiting any `actor.*` mutation call, and (3) set the guard back to false in a `finally` block. Update the UI so that any button that triggers a guarded action is disabled while its guard is true, and its label changes while saving (use English labels exactly: “Saving...”, “Deleting...”, “Updating...”).",

(B) Add Ringkasan Master Data summary counts computed from already-fetched Master Data state (no new endpoints): Kamus Pekerjaan activeCount vs archivedCount, Aturan Beban activeCount vs archivedCount, Master Data Map total keys (when available), and Konstanta Unit Client value + updatedAt. (C) If the Master Data datasets needed for these counts are not present in state when Ringkasan is opened/refreshed, trigger a lightweight fetch of the existing Master Data reads already implemented in this file, then compute and render the counts.
