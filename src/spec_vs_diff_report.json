  "summary": "REQ-110 appears implemented in InternalLogin via a gated one-time effect that runs once actor is ready (actor exists and actorFetching is false) and then sets claimCheckDone. Due to truncation of InternalLogin.tsx, REQ-111 and REQ-112 behaviors (no redirect on claim success; claim error follow-up re-check and friendly messaging) cannot be fully verified from the provided diff excerpt. Additionally, the diff includes modifications to non-allowed-scope files (frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json), which were not requested by the BuildRequest constraints.",
